## Setting up development enviroment

* `npm install -g create-react-app` 

* `create-react-app headstart`

* `npm start`
    Starts the development server.

* `npm run build`
    Bundles the app into static files for production.

* `npm test`
    Starts the test runner.

* `npm run eject`
    Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
    and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you can’t go back!

## Why React?

* It is javascript library (not framework) to build user interfaces.	
	* Framework
		* Limited flexibility: To things a certain way and hard to deviate.	
		* Large & full of feature: So hard to customize & use the whole thing

* React is declarative means we will tell react what to build and it will take care how to do it.

* The Virtual Browser (vs DOM API) and just javascript

* React native to build mobile apps & battle tested by Facebook

* More details (https://jscomplete.com/learn/why-react)

## Basic Concepts
 
* Component
	- Like functions
	- Inputs: Props (Immutable) + State (Mutable) => Model
	- Use as `<Component />`
	- Model + Component => DOM (Virtual)
	- Function/Class Component
```javascirpt
	//Input => Props & State
	
	//Function component
	const Card = (props) => {
		return (
			<domElementOrComponent .../>
		)
	}	

	//Class Component
	class Card extends React.Component {
		render() {
			return (<domElementOrComponent .../>)
		}
	}

	//Output => DOM	
```
 	
* Reactive updates
	- Takes updates from browser
	- DOM Events => Sends back to State and trigger another render cycle
	- Generate HTML using Javascript
	- No Html Templates!!
	- Tree reconcilation (Use virtual DOM - Only required element re-render not entire DOM node )

* JSX
	* It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript.
	* After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects.
	* This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions:
```javascript
function display(value) {
  if (value) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(value)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
}
```
	* JSX prevents Injections attacks. By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application.

## The component life cycle

* Mouting : These method called when a component instance is created and inserted into DOM
	
	* `constructor`		
		- Basically used to intialise state using this.state, bind event handler methods to an instace & use props by calling super(props). Otherwise not required.
		- It is called before component is mounted
		```javascript
		constructor(props) {
		super(props);
		// Don't call this.setState() here!
		this.state = { counter: 0 };
		this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
		}
		```

	* `static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state)`
		- getDerivedStateFromProps is invoked right before calling the render method, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. 
		- It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing.
		- This method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time. 
		- For example, it might be handy for implementing a <Transition> component that compares its previous and next children to decide which of them to animate in and out.
	
	* `render()`
		- When called it exmines `this.props` & `this.state` and return React element and respective rendered data
		- It should not modify component state

	* `componentDidMount()`
		- Invoked after component is mounted (i.e. inserted into DOM tree)
		- This is ideal place to set up any subscription
		- You can setState() which will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before browser updates screen. But user wont able to see changed state.

* Updating: An update due to change in props or state which will trigger re-rendering

	* `shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState)`
		- This method only exists as a performance optimization. Do not rely on it to “prevent” a rendering, as this can lead to bugs
		- If you are confident you want to write it by hand, you may compare this.props with nextProps and this.state with nextState and return false to tell React the update can be skipped. Note that returning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes.

	* `getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState)`
		- getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() is invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to e.g. the DOM. 
		- It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) before it is potentially changed. 
		- Any value returned by this lifecycle will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate().
		- A snapshot value (or null) should be returned.

	* `componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot)`
		- Invoked fater updating occurs, this method not called for initial rendering.
		- It ideal place to operated on DOM when component has been update.

* Unmounting: Called when component is being removed from DOM

	* `componentDidCatch(error, info)`
		- Invoked after an error has been thrown by descendent component.
		- Called during the commit phase

	* `componentWillUnmount`
		- componentWillUnmount() is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. 
		- Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in componentDidMount().


## React-Redux

* Why?

	- For complex Significant setup e.g. When two completely different component access same data (both can call API for same data
	  which is completely redundant)
	- Avoid Prop drilling, sending shared data across component from Top level component through props, and this gets even worse 
	  if you have more layers of components between the data source and end component
	- Redux solve this problem my maintaining store (We can Also use react context to avoid props drilling)

* When?

	- Has Complex data flows
	- Has Frequent Inter-component communicatios
	- Has Non-heirarchical data
	- Has many actions (CRUD)
	- Same data used in many places

* Principles

	- One Immutable store
	- Action reperesents user intent
	- Action triggers changes (User actions)
	- Actions must have return type
	- Reducers updates state, all reducer called upon each action where switch will handle changed action
	  all other return default untouched state
	- Each action can be handled by multiple reducers

* Flux vs Redux

	- Flux is precursor of redux
	- Both have unidirection data flow, actions and store concepts (Flux has multiple stores)

| Flux |Redux |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|
| Stores contain state & change logic  | Store & change logic are separate |
| Multiple Store  | One Store  |
| Flat & Disconnected Store  | Single Store with hierarchical reducers  |
| Singletone dispatcher  | No dispatcher  |
| React component subscribe to stores  | Container component utilize connect  |
| State is mutated  | State is immutable  |
